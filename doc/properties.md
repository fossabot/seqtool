# Properties

Properties are key-value pairs stored in the FASTA/FASTQ definition
line. They are stored in the form `propname=value` by using the
`-p` option:

```bash
seqtool . -p a=b input.fa
```

produces something like:

```
>id1 a=b
SEQUENCE
>id2 a=b
SEQUENCE
(...)
```

Properties become useful when using [variables](variables):

```bash
seqtool . -p num={num} input.fa
```
```
>id1 num=1
SEQUENCE
>id2 num=2
SEQUENCE
(...)
```

They can be located at any place and will be recognized if preceded by a space.

The `-p` option is available in any command that returns FASTA/FASTQ sequences,
not just in the `pass` (`.`) command. It can be used multiple times in the
same command if more than one property has to be added.

### Other formats

It is also possible to use other delimiters by specifying `--pdelim`. This
allows parsing size annotations in files generated by
[usearch](http://drive5.com/usearch/):

```bash
# cluster at 90% identity
usearch -cluster_fast seqs.fa -id 0.97 -sizeout -centroids clusters.fa
```
*clusters.fa:*
```
>seq_1;size=343;
SEQUENCE
(...)
```
Extract cluster ids and sizes into a tab delimited txt file:
```
seqtool . --to-txt id,p:size --pdelim ';' clusters.fa
```

Output:

```
seq1	343
(...)
```

The `=` delimiter can be customized with `--pval-delim`.
